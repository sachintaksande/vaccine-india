# "IMPORTANT:::: If you face problems with emails not being sent from the smtp configurations you have, please allow less secure apps in your account. Log in to your gmail account which you have configured and then visit https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and allow less secure apps."

# Create a new file called `config.json` from the `config.example.json` in the root directory and add desired smtp credentials and listeners. The default duration to poll is 15 minutes which can be customized in the `config.json` file. The configuration is self explainatory I hope.
